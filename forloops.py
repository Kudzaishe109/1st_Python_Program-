#loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times
#They are two types of loops: while loops and for loops 

#for loops is used to iterate over a sequence(list, tuples sets, dict, string, or range)

#Syntax:
#for variable in sequence:
    # statements

# fruits = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

text = 'kudzi'
for char in text:
    print(char)
